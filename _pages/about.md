I am a PhD candidate in space physics at the University of New Hampshire [Space Sciences Center](https://eos.unh.edu/space-science-center) under the guidance of [Dr. Matthew Argall](https://eos.unh.edu/person/matthew-argall), and supported by a NASA FINESST fellowship. My research focus includes magnetospheric physics (MI coupling, magnetic reconnection, electric field), and ML/AI for space weather prediction. I am also interested in the intersection between computer vision and physics, including visualization and physics-based simulation.

I have previous experience at Los Alamos National Laboratory [Theoretical Division](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/), [NorthWest Research Associates](https://www.nwra.com/), and most recently at a contract researcher at Frontier Development Lab [Heliolab](https://fdl.ai/heliolab). Current projects section coming soon!
