I am a forth year physics PhD student within the [Space Sciences Center](https://eos.unh.edu/space-science-center) at the University of New Hampshire working under [Dr. Matthew Argall](https://eos.unh.edu/person/matthew-argall). 

I utilize machine learning and modeling techniques to better understand Earth's magnetosphere.
