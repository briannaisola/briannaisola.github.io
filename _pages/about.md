I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student at the University of New Hampshire [Space Sciences Center](https://eos.unh.edu/space-science-center), specializing in magnetospheric physics under the guidance of [Dr. Matthew Argall](https://eos.unh.edu/person/matthew-argall). My research involves employing modeling and machine learning to analyze magnetospheric dynamics and forcecast space weather events. My interest include magnetospheric modeling, magnetic reconnection, and solar-terrestrail energy transfer. 

## News & Updates
* I will be attending the American Geophysical Union fall meeting this December in San Francsisco, CA. I will be presented two posters. The first is an invited poster on Monday morning 12/11 on my machine learning work with MMS, and my second poster will be on Wednesday morning, 12/13, on my work with Los Alamos National Laboratory. You can find copies of my posters [here](/files/BI-AGU23-MMS.pdf) and [here](/files/BI-AGU23-LANL.pdf)
