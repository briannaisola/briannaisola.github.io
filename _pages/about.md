I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student at the University of New Hampshire [Space Sciences Center](https://eos.unh.edu/space-science-center), specializing in magnetospheric physics under the guidance of [Dr. Matthew Argall](https://eos.unh.edu/person/matthew-argall). My research involves employing modeling and machine learning to analyze magnetospheric dynamics and forcecast space weather events. My interest include magnetospheric modeling, magnetic reconnection, systems science, and solar-terrestrial energy transfer. 

## News & Updates
* I will be attending the American Geophysical Union fall meeting this December in San Francsisco, CA. I will be presenting two posters, one invited.
